instead of going back and forth over email, I'm just gonna point you here as much as possible.

If you would like to run these notebooks, follow these steps: https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#alternative-for-experienced-python-users-installing-jupyter-with-pip

And while we're at it here's how you use github. First, open up your command prompt.

* Go to the desktop directory ```cd Desktop```
* Make a directory called github ```mkdir github```
* Go to the github directory ```cd github```
* Copy files from this repository, into the github directory ```git clone https://github.com/g-rock/dad.git```
* Now, all the files on github are in `dad`. 

:telephone: me if you need any help. Otherwise, the examples show up in a pretty nice format [if you click on them](https://github.com/g-rock/dad/blob/master/trigger_ex.ipynb).
